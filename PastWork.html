	     <p>Here's are my many weird and unfinished games I've worked on</p>

         <big><big><big>Pulverizer, Agents of the Grinder</big></big></big><br>
         <p>Pulverizer was the first game I've worked on under this name. It's a top down zombie shooter, you play as "Agents" on a gameshow where you shoot reanimated corpses. I worked on this for a extremely long time, probably learned the most from this game. The biggest being how to actually make a fun game</p><br>

         <img src="Resources/Graphics/GameScreencaps/Done.PNG" alt="Blog image" style="max-width:100%;"><br>
         <p>If you wanna see more of the game, I have plenty of videos and pictures of it on my youtube channel, twitter, and tumblr. I also have a older verison of it released when it was unnamed and I wanted opinions from the tigsource forums</p><br>
         <a href="https://lonelygamedev.itch.io/zombietestproject">Old verison</a><br>
         
         <big><big><big>Fetch Quest Simulator</big></big></big><br>
         <p>This was a game I made for Ludum Dare 53, I was playing alot of zelda at the time. So I decided to make a zelda ripoff and despite overscoping, I actually made a pretty impressive game</p><br>

         <big><big><big>Destroy the Wizard</big></big></big><br>
         <p>I made this for Ludum dare 55. I'm fairly proud of this one sense not only was it fairly fun to play, and I got a fairly high fun rating. I think it was in the top 500 games but I could be wrong</p><br>

         <big><big><big>Warped Horizons</big></big></big><br>
         <p>This was the second big project I made after Pulverizer. A event happened to me that made me think about my future, so I decided to work on a big "Dream Game". In this game you where going to build space ships that allow for electrical systems and piping and fly around the galaxy</p><br>

         <p>Game is currently put on the backburner after I missed the steam nextfest deadline and I decided to work on a smaller game</p><br>
         
         <big><big><big>Unnamed FPS</big></big></big><br>
         <p>Working on Warped Horizons made me realize I need a smaller game that I can finish coding in a small amount of time, so I can focus on schooling and chores. So I decided to work on a game I made for 7DFPS, and fix it up sense it was extremely broken to the point of being unplayable. The game is a FPS wave shooter where you unlock levels and beat them</p><br>

         <big><big><big>Misc</big></big></big><br>
         <p>Smaller games I never released</p><br>
         
         <img src="Resources/Graphics/GameScreencaps/Euclid Game Engine.png" alt="Blog image" style="max-width:100%;"><br>
         <p>This was a game engine I worked on called "Euclid", and got pretty far with. It's made in OpenTK, so sense everything is in C#, I was able to do alot. I eventually stopped because there's not much on exporting games</p><br>
         
         <img src="Resources/Graphics/GameScreencaps/Prison.png" alt="Blog image" style="max-width:100%;"><br>
         <p>Around early 2025, I was burnt out on pulverizer and was quite angry. So I briefly worked on a small FPS called "Empire of dirt". I was able to get a quick prototype up, but it failed apart due to how long it took to make levels and the many issues with saving</p><br>
         
         <img src="Resources/Graphics/GameScreencaps/Apartment case.png" alt="Blog image" style="max-width:100%;"><br>
         <p>Small horror game I worked on, It was very much inspired by a movie called "The raid redemption" where you're stuck in a quarantine block with zombies. There where design issues with it</p><br>
         
         <img src="Resources/Graphics/GameScreencaps/Heresay.png" alt="Blog image" style="max-width:100%;"><br>
         <p>"Heresay" started out when after the failure of Empire of dirt, I had the idea of using a Doom WAD editor to make levels and put them in unity. That turned into a doom clone, then into a exploration FPS where you play as a preacher descenting into hell with House of leaves style illusions. With multiplayer, coop, bots. I'll likely return to this sometime, sense I love the idea of explorating with a M16</p><br>
